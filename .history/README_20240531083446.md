### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

# Project 3: Around The U.S.

In this project, we created an interactive webpage with a responsive layout for cards using CSS Grid and Flexbox. The page features a modern design that seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The layout showcases a grid of beautiful image cards with titles and like buttons, arranged in a flexible manner to accommodate different resolutions. By leveraging the power of CSS Grid for the overall structure and Flexbox for aligning elements within each card, we achieved a dynamic and visually appealing interface.
